## ABSTRACT
The role of central nervous system glia in sustaining self-autonomous inflammation and driving clinical progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) is attracting increasing scientific interest. Here, we applied a single transcription factor (SOX10)-based protocol for accelerating oligodendrocyte differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural precursor cells to produce three dimensional, submillimetric self-organizing forebrain organoids (consisting of neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursors cells, and oligodendrocytes). To achieve immunocompetence, hiPSC-derived microglia was also incorporated. Within an 8-week time frame, organoids reproducibly generated a rich diversity of mature cell types, with single-cell transcriptional profiles similar to the human adult brain. When exposed to the inflamed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients, organoids properly mimic macroglia-microglia neurodegenerative phenotypes and their intercellular communication, as seen in chronic active multiple sclerosis. A later-onset vulnerability of oligodendrocytes (with a nearly 50% reduction) was observed by day 6 following MS-CSF exposure. The temporally resolved organoid data support and further expand on the role of soluble CSF mediators in sustaining a downstream cascade of events that ultimately lead to the death of oligodendrocytes and inflammatory neurodegeneration. The results obtained pave the way for the implementation of this novel 3D model in the identification of druggable targets for inflammatory neurodegeneration as drug screening platform.
